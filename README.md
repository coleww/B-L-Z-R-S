# B L Z R S
------------------

making a website band

it also can maybe poop out some midi notes and perform music "IRL" idk w/e

###### TODO
------------------

- pass bpm/key/tonic/etc. as URL args
  - hrm, can it update on change? probably!
  - ideally there should be no interface in the main window/document, just a bunch of gifs or smth
- set up copy pasta template instrument files for all the modules found
- make a separate instrument bundle workflow for getting config settings to be :100:
  - i guess just build the thing and throw randomized reasonable data at it?
- how to handle tts? will prbly have to do it on startup to get rhyming happening
  - or just don't do markov at all, or use tracery to fill in template phrases that must rhyme


### lib 
---------
all of these are some sort of GPL, so the whole thing must be GPL'd,
but also like, therefore none of the dependencies can be BSD or certain other licences??

- akrennmair/libmp3lame-js
