# B L Z R S
------------------

making a website band

it also can maybe poop out some midi notes and perform music "IRL"

###### HRRRRM
------------------


- VOICE: it will have to do this ahead of time probably? or will it just process "fast enough"?
  - option A: dont care, just generate/decode/play tts as needed
  - option B: generate an entire "song" ahead of time, shift buffers off an array as needed
  - option C: use a verse/chorus/bridge sort of idea, each section has a group of buffers...

#### TODO

- npm install/configure a bunch of rly *makes a click click sound* web audio synths
- erm, use the other thing to get garbage data and copy paste away?

#### IDEAS

- make a gif for each inst/sequence/pattern...err. yeah. overlay them w/ transparency?
- split window into panes, play videos, images.
